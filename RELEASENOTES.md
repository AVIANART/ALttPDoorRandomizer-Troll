# New Features

Bomb Logic added as an option. This removes your ability to use bombs until you find a "bomb bag", a +10 Bomb Capacity item. It is accounted for in the logic, so you aren't expected to get items behind bomb walls until you have found the bomb capacity item. The upgrades are removed from the upgrade fairy as well.
 
```
--bomblogic
```
